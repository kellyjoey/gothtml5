                <h3>Winter is Coming</h3>
                <p>Season 1, Episode 1</p>
                <p class="summary">Have you heard the news about winter?  It's coming.</p>
                <p>So there’s 4 houses here in the land of all the white people - there’s the Starks (who are in the North wherever that is) and the Lannisters (the twins and the dwarf).  Then there’s the Criss Angel People and the Blondes (Targer-ish something).  So the round dude is the king and Lena Heady is the Queen.  And some dude named Aaron died who was the right hand to the King and Lena Heady like might’ve killed him cause he knew she’s totally having sex with her twin brother.  There’s 5 Stark kids, plus Jon Snow who’s a bastard.  Three boys, two girls.  Oh and there were like these White Walker zombie people at the beginning and people seem to think they don’t exist, but clearly they do.  Anyhow.  So over in the world of the Blondes and Criss Angel things are like truly terrible.  Like I am filled with dread every time we go visit them.  And Blonde Girl (Kaleesi Kahleesi, whatever, I’m guessing, I think that’s her name) has to marry Criss Angel - also she got dragon eggs that people think are merely decorative, but I’m gonna bet they’re not.  But other than that it’s awful.  I mean, I get that in real medieval times women had no power and got raped, but this world has zombies and presumably eventually dragons so do they like Have to be raped in this magical fantasy world?  Yes?  They do?  OK.  Sure.  Anyhow back in the Way More Complicated Story.  Ned Stark is gonna have to go be the right hand to the king.  The king used to want to be with Ned Stark’s sister.  Ned Stark’s wife’s sister was married to that Aaron dude who is dead.  And Ned Stark’s wife gets a message that her sister has fled the capital (King’s Landing - c’mon now I paid attention, I know things) because she thinks the Lannisters straight up murdered her husband.  Also one of Ned Stark’s kid’s died (cause, you know, Lannisters) so now he’s down to just the 4.  Also he’s leaving.  Or he left, I guess.  Maybe.  The end.</p>

                <h3>The Kingsroad</h3>
                <p>Season 1, Episode 2</p>
                <p class="summary">So the little dude didn't die.</p>
                <p>He’s just in a coma or something.  So Now everyone’s leaving?  So Joan Allen (Ned Stark’s wife - Cat, apparently, or Kat I guess more probably) doesn’t like Jon Snow cause you know he’s like not her kid.  He (Jon Snow) tells everyone bye cause he’s gonna go join the Knight Watch . . .the Night Watch . . .?  The uh . . .Lannisters are all freaked out cause the kid isn’t dead.  And clearly the dwarf dude knows about his freaky siblings and seems amused that they might get caught.  Queen Lannister goes and visits the kid and Joan Allen and tells a sob story and basically acts real creepy cause she totally wants to kill him.  Oh what am I missing?  It’s the uh Criss Angel tribe traveling and we get to see Blonde Girl get raped some more.  It’s like truly terrible.  It feels gratuitous.  I’m upset about it.  But then they do something I’m not Totally upset about, but still kind of which is that Blonde Girl has these servant handmaiden people and one of them who used to have to be a prostitute volunteers to show Blonde Girl some tricks.  And that’s a good time.  (But I know I’m being baited with this scene and this is not what this show is.  This is false advertising.)  But then much later the “pay off” if you will of that scene is Blonde-Khaleesi-whatever still having to have sex with this dude, but we’re supposed to see the victory in the fact that she is now controlling the position.  Great.  Good for her.  She seems to be “enjoying” it and I’m like cool so Criss Angel’s like not a rapist now because he let her be on top?  What the fuck.  The show’s all like, now it’s OK and romantic because she’s getting physical pleasure from the sex that she is forced to have.  Hooray for feminism!  So that covers about 2 minutes of the episode.  In other news, Jon Snow is gonna go take vows and become a monk who guards a wall from zombies.  They travel, he sees the wall for the first time.  It’s giant.  End of his story.  Also, a hit man comes to kill Starks (over in Winterfell, cause see I know the names of some things) and Joan Allen and a wolf fight him off.  (I was genuinely excited and pleased to watch this woman, then this wolf kill this dude.)  Then she’s all like “this dude was definitely sent by Lannisters.  I’m gonna go let my people know.  I’m just gonna go.  Boys you stay here and mind the kingdom.”  Then you’ve got the King and Ned’s traveling crew.  There’s this creepy Children of Corn looking Prince (that let’s just say for sure is the offspring of incest) and the Ginger Stark is stupidly into him.  There’s this whole thing where her tough younger sister (who is awesome by the way) beats him up (second moment of unabashed excitement and cheering).  This leads to the tough girl having to Old Yeller her wolf who helped with the beating.  And Ginger Stark’s wolf has to die for her sins.  And button to the episode when Little Dude in a coma suddenly wakes up.  So I guess we’ll find out if he remembers the whole Flowers in the Attic moment that he witnessed or if he’s like the dude from Memento now.</p>

                <h3>Lord Snow</h3>
                <p>Season 1, Episode 3</p>
                <p class="summary">In which we find out what passes for fun in King's Landing</p>
                <p>OK so in no particular order:  Ned’s crew arrives in King’s Landing - it looks like some Biblical dramatization of Jesus riding into town on a donkey.  Ned heads to a meeting with the rest of the King’s cabinet members - but he runs into the Lannister who looks like the Prince from Shrek.  They have this conversation where they’re trying to out-intimidate the other one.  But it ends up just being some hard to follow exposition about how Prince Lannister stabbed “the mad king” in the back and how Ned’s dad was burned in this room.  And it all begs the question: how did these people end up teamed up together?  Anyhow in the cabinet meeting we find out that the Kingdom or the King or however this works is in super debt . . .most of it to the Lannisters.  So the Lannisters are basically China and will soon have a better space program than anyone else.  Also Joan Allen arrives in King's Landing to tell Ned about the Lannister hit man. She meets with some dude at a whore house because half naked ladies make great set dressing. If you are a woman cast on this show - there's a 90% chance you're playing a prostitute. Anyhow, turns out the hit man was probably sent by Dwarf Lannister.  When Joan Allen leaves the capital she and Ned stare at each other and the music makes this all seem Very Meaningful - like they're never seeing each other again. So there's that. The King presents a Shakespearian monologue about his first time . . .killing a man.  It’s really something.  Then he makes some other dudes talk about killing people.  This is what passes for fun in King’s Landing.  Jon Snow is up there at the wall with the Knights/Nights Watch.  The wall is giant, they’ve installed an elevator.  Jon Snow is the best fighter in his class, but has to be told by like three different people that he’s not a special snowflake and to start being a team player.  Um, one tidbit of news from Winterfell, Little Dude (Bran, I think) is awake, but says he can’t remember anything.  Also he can’t walk.  Bummer.  One brief visit to the tribe of Criss Angel and the Blondes - Khaleesi (still I don’t know, this seems to be her title or something) has decided she has some power now and is starting to exercise it.  Also one of her handmaidens feels her up and decides that she’s pregnant.  (People keep saying this is a blessing from the “Great Stallion”.  Is that their god or is that Criss Angel?  This may be my most important question of the episode.)  So Kahleesi (look, I’m never spelling that the same way.  It’s just not happening.  Anyway, I don’t speak Dothrakian.  Oh yeah, I’m just throwing names around now.) tells Criss Angel that they’re having a boy.  Because she just knows.  And also they seem to be in love now because he lets her be on top.  So many great classic romances are based on this same thing.  So many.  Hmmm, what am I missing?  Oh there was a heartwarming mother-son talk between Lena Headey (Cersei - right?   I mean I could look up how to spell these things, but I’m not in this for the research.) and little Children of the Corn prince.  It’s just that classic conversation where he asks if he has to marry the nice Ginger Stark and his mother says yes, but if he wants to and I quote “fuck painted whores” he will be able to do that as well.  Super.  Also Little Tough Stark gets sword-fighting lessons as Ned looks on approvingly and then seems to go through some battle PTSD as they roll the credits.

                <h3>Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things</h3>
                <p>Season 1, Episode 4</p>
                <p class="summary">AKA so much fucking exposition.</p>
                <p>In Winterfell, little crippled Stark has got a Groot sidekick to carry him around now.  Dwarf Lannister showed up and was nice to little crippled Rocket Raccoon, telling him that he could ride a horse someday.  And there was some exposition with Dwarf and this blonde dude that I thought was a Stark, but maybe apparently was just somebody the Stark’s won in some battle.  They super lost me on that one.  Up at the Wall, there’s a new dude named Sam who is basically Piggy from Lord of the Flies - which was an analogy I thought of BEFORE their knight coach threatened to eat him.  Sam and Jon Snow are friends and Jon Snow is a virgin.  That’s what we learned . . .in addition to a long monologue from the Knight Coach about how bad winter was.  People freakin’ love remembering how bad winter was, it’s like their favorite story.  I was super unhappy when it was time to go visit the Dothrakian/Blonde crew.  I always dread what’s going to happen there.  So Khaleesi’s Blonde Brother is getting it on with the same handmaiden who had been all up on Khaleesi in that one episode where that one lesbian thing happened.  That scene included A LOT of exposition about dragons because the best way to deliver exposition is with a naked lady in the shot.  Later Blonde Brother starts being a dick to Khaleesi and she hits him and even later talks about how she has no confidence in his ability to be king.  OK now in King’s Landing there’s this episode of Law and Order going on where Ned is going around trying to figure out what John Aaron - the King’s hand that died/was definitely murdered, probably by a lady - was up to before he bit it.  Basically the only thing Ned learns was that Aaron must’ve tracked down the King’s bastard son working in a blacksmith shop.  Little Tough Stark is all excited about learning sword-fighting.  In this conversation with her dad about if she could be lord of a land when she grew up - he tells her she can be Married to a Lord and give Birth to little Lords and it’s gonna be great.  And she just goes “nah”.  This girl is my hero.  Also there’s a Renaissance Festival, I mean, jousting tournament going on where Little Finger tells a story of the Hound and the Mountain.  Why did he tell us this story?  Because this is the episode of so much Fucking Exposition.  People just talked and talked and talked and then at the end Joan Allen runs into Dwarf Lannister in a bar and calls up her buddies to arrest him cause she thinks he tried to kill her little Raccoon (aka her son Bran).  Good grief. </p>

                <h3>The Wolf and the Lion</h3>
                <p>Season 1, Episode 5</p>
                <p class="summary">In which we witness exposition sex and the bloody deaths of people we don't know</p>
                <p>So we open with this dude (that I was so sure died in the jousting match last time) laid out on a table.  He was the former squire to the Hand and these ladies are like sewing him up while Ned and some dude talk to each other.  And then they leave and I’m still like - he’s dead, right?  I’m not clear.  Seems like a weird thing to not know.  But anyway, this episode is mostly about how the king is totally unfit to be in charge.  The King wants to joust and Ned is like don’t be stupid.  Then we see this gay rockstar dude in shiny, over the top armor (like if a drag queen designed a suit of armor - that would be his armor) go against the Mountain.  Gay rockstar knocks him off his horse and then the Mountain straight up beheads his own horse!  But Why?!  Then the Hound (I think is what they called him last time, you know, dude with the scars) has to defend the gay rockstar.  It was nuts.  Later we see that the gay rockstar seems to be the boyfriend/body barber to the king’s brother.  I mean, I don’t know if they’re boyfriends, maybe they’re not into labels.  But king’s brother was getting a blow job, so that’s the facts of the situation.  In other sex news, the dude who I thought was a Stark, but then turned out maybe he wasn’t - that dude had some exposition sex with a prostitute so we could learn that he was a Greyjoy (and I have literally no idea what that means) and he became a “ward” to the Starks when he was little.  And if you’re keeping score at home - there was a full frontal shot of both the dude and the girl in this scene.  Equal opportunity nudity.  Let’s leave all this for a minute and go visit Joan Allen and the dwarf who she’s taken prisoner.  They’re on the road apparently to her sister’s place.  (Her sister!  John Aaron’s widow!  I’m following this!)  Her sister lives someplace called the Eyrie (maybe that’s how it’s spelled).  And Dwarf tries to warn Joan Allen that her sister’s gone crazy since the last time she saw her.  Some little army shows up and attacks their little caravan.  And I thought they were there to save the Lannister but he also ends up killing some of them.  So it was a great excuse for lots of bloody deaths of people we didn’t know.  We get to the Eyrie and her sister is breastfeeding her full grown child.  Kid’s gotta be well into elementary school.  Joan Allen gets the picture real quick that this is going off the rails.  Dwarf gets thrown in a dungeon and that’s where we leave him.  The stuff in King’s Landing is so complicated right now.  There’s lots of conspiring and rumors and nonsense.  Arya (maybe, you know, Little Tough Stark) hears some people talking about how they killed the last King’s Hand and they could just kill another one.  So she gets freaked out that her dad’s gonna get murdered.  Ned just keeps finding more of the King’s bastard kids.  Word has gotten to the capital that Khaleesi is pregnant and now the King wants her murdered.  Ned’s not up for murdering pregnant ladies so he has to quit his job.  Word also travels that a Stark has taken a Lannister prisoner.  So the Shrek Prince (okay Jaime, his name is Jaime, how . . .boring) hunts down Ned and kills Ned’s favorite guard buddy and fights Ned until one of Jaime’s guard buddies stabs Ned in the back of the leg.  And that’s where we leave him - bleeding out in the courtyard of a whorehouse.  Not, I’m sure, where he’d like to spend his final moments.  So we’ll presume he survives to die another day.  </p>

                <h3>A Golden Crown</h3>
                <p>Season 1, Episode 6</p>
                <p class="summary">In which Ned has to figure out paternity without the help of Maury</p>
                <p>Little Bran Stark finally got his occupational therapy saddle so he’s not bed ridden, now he can be horse ridden.  He goes out in the woods and gets caught up with these swamp looking people.  His brothers come rescue him and murder all the swampies except the swamp lady who I don’t know maybe they’re going to keep her.  There is just talk everywhere that the Starks and Lannisters are going to raise up armies and kill each other because of the whole taking the dwarf prisoner and fighting the Shrek prince in the whorehouse courtyard.  Apparently word by raven travels fast cause everyone has heard the gossip about this stuff.  They even managed to shoehorn in a scene where the Greyjoy’s favorite prostitute rides by on her way out of town because of all the talk about war.  Greyjoy tosses her a coin and she obliging lifts her skirt because they were afraid we might all stop watching if we were not shown a semi-naked woman.  Wow they almost lost all of our attention, but nothing some good old female exploitation won’t fix.  Over in Creepville aka the Eyrie, Dwarf spends a bunch of time playing out comic scenes with his dumb prison guard until he convinces them to let him out and give him a trial.  After a bunch of talking and some dudes fighting he goes free.  Good for him.  Over in King’s Landing, Ned’s walking with a cane now and wants Lannisters brought to justice to which the King tells him basically no way, shut it down.  The King also informs him he can’t quit, he’s still the Hand.  Little Tough Stark is still getting her sword fighting training montages.  Her sister, Ginger Stark, is like training to be a 1950s housewife.  Her blonde boy shows up and gives her jewelry and apologizes and kisses her.  And she eats it up.  But I’m wondering what car or pony they promised this kid to say all this crap.  Because if you’ll recall, he’s actually awful.  Also he’s very clearly actually Not the King’s Son.  Which Ned puts together very slowly by reading the genealogy book he borrowed from the library.  He very astutely notes that the whole family has black hair.  The book had to tell him that, not his eyes, since he’s met like a bunch of the King’s bastard children at this point.  But good for you, Ned.  Also there was some weird news that the Mountain went out with some dudes and attacked some random village.  All of this seems to be another Lannister attack on the Starks.  But thankfully all the raping and pillaging happened offstage this time and we were spared seeing it.  Oh and I saved the best for last.  Over in Dothrakville, Khaleesi finds she can stick dragon eggs and her hands in fire and neither of them burn up.  Also she finds she can eat an entire raw horse heart in front of a crowd without throwing up everywhere.  So good for her.  Also her brother comes and causes a scene at a party that looks exactly like the ones Jabba the Hutt would throw in his cave.  I keep expecting to see him hanging around the corner of the tent with some lady in a metal bikini.  Anyhow, her brother comes in being all “I’m the dragon, I’m the king!”  And thus we see Criss Angel grant him the crown he was asking for by pouring a pot of molten gold over his head.  That is one blonde down, so many others still running around.

                <h3>You Win or You Die</h3>
                <p>Season 1, Episode 7</p>
                <p class="summary">I don't even know where to begin with this episode.  What a mess.</p>
                <p>Look the one thing I know happened was The King Died.  That for sure happened.  He apparently got in a fight with a boar and lost.  Maybe that’s all we need to know and we can just all go home and ignore the rest of this mess. . .OK I will give this a shot.  Jamie Lannister gets a lecture from his dad on how he needs to step up and show everyone who’s boss.  But I could barely hear him over the sight of him butchering some giant hoofed animal.  It was grotesque and distracting but not nearly as distracting as . . .  the scene with Little Finger in the whorehouse.  So one thing that was happening was that two women were . . .rehearsing, let’s say, their prostitution skills with each other.  And the dude stops them and says no, no you’re doing it wrong, try again.  They proceed to perform this soft core porn scene with one of them doing lots of moaning while the dude and the girl doing the other girl carry on an unrelated conversation.  He just monologues and monologues and I literally have no idea what about because A) I am a human creature who can be distracted if you put this stuff in front of me. B) Because I couldn’t hear him over the moaning.  and C) Because it was so Incredibly Unrealistic and infuriating that I can’t even go into it.  But if we were supposed to learn anything from what felt like the 57 minute long sex scene that played over his monologue I got none of it.  Hope that wasn’t important!  The rest of the stuff gets even more convoluted.  Jon Snow should be taking his Knight Vows up at the wall, but instead of making him a Ranger they made him a maid - a steward technically.  He throws a fit, but his BFF Sam talks him down.  Jon and Sam are the #relationshipgoals of this show.  In Winterfell, the Greyjoy dude talks to the swamp lady they captured in the woods.  He wants to get with her, but gets interrupted.  Over in Agrabah (not the name of the place, I know, it’s an Aladdin reference) Khaleesi (which I get that’s her title, not her name) is over trying to talk Criss Angel into crossing an Ocean.  He clearly thinks boats run on black magic and is refusing.  Then some dude tries to poison her and Criss Angel gets riled up and gives what looks like a rousing football halftime speech about how they’re gonna go pound those guys and take their throne and enslave their children and rape their women!  Literally.  He says this in front of his wife and she looks at him like she is so turned on right now.  This whole episode is a male fantasy of how women work. And so like OK… King’s Landing.  The king was dying and he seemed to want Ned to watch over things till Joffrey got old enough and then Ned was like trying to line up the king’s oldest brother to take over.  And then of course the Lannisters just literally have the little dude sit on the throne and try to claim it.  And like all these soldiers and Ned and . . .I don’t know the whole room just erupts into chaos with Little Finger putting a dagger to Ned’s throat.  The end.  What a mess.  The king died.  We should’ve just left it at that.

                <h3>The Pointy End</h3>
                <p>Season 1, Episode 8</p>
                <p class="summary">How many Starks are there!?</p>
                <p>We pick up right where we left off with King’s Landing in chaos.  Dudes with swords running around slaughtering people.  Ned’s been taken prisoner, Samsa (I don’t actually know that girl’s name.  It’s something like Samsung.) is kept alive and Arya straight up murders some kid who tried to capture her and ran away.  Good for her.  Word of this setup then travels across the realm.  Ned’s been accused of treason so Jon’s up at the wall getting hazed over it.  Also some white walkers showed up and Jon learned you kill them with fire.  You Kill Them With Fire Everyone.  We all know that now, shouldn’t have any problem with them.  When the treason news gets to Winterfell the oldest son (Rob apparently, couldn’t have told you his name before this episode) gathers an army and heads out to save his dad.  Right before he does Bran begs him to let him go too.  Rob says no, he leaves, and this little blonde kid runs in and I’m like who is this kid?  Bran’s friend?  Wait, no, he’s a Stark?! Who is this kid?  How many Starks are there?  How is there Another Brother?!  I think they’re just adding family and expecting all of us to just accept that we must’ve forgotten meeting them.  But no way, I don’t believe this kid was ever seen before this moment.  You cannot fool me, Throne creators!  You just made him up and I bet he disappears and we never hear of him again!  I’m onto you.  Right so Joan Allen was still at her creepy sisters and she asks to borrow her sister’s army and her sister is like no way, Lannisters murder people, I will be keeping my army here with me.  Joan Allen goes and meets up with Rob and his army.  She is disapproving of his war choices, specifically his choice to include himself in the war, but she’s not going to stop him.  What else?  Tyrian (Tear ee an,  Teereean, dwarf, you get it) is wandering around with his one guard he picked up from Creepsville.  They are attacked by a roving band of Pirate/Viking/Hill people.  He uses his smooth talking to get them to not kill him and just ride along with them.  He tells the Hill People - all this, everything the light touches, could be yours.  So they buy it and they go meet up with the Lannister army.  And finally last but not least the always pleasant Dothrakians.  Khaleesi is witnessing some sheep herder village getting fucked up.  There’s beating and pillaging and this is because they’re going to sell some sheep herders into slavery.  They’ve got the women penned up and some dude’s going to have his way with one of them.  Oh you know that’s such a polite euphemism “have his way with”.  No no he was about to rape her when Khaleesi stops it from happening and orders all the women to be given to her.  Right so she is intermittently awesome and powerful.  She has to go see Criss Angel to defend her decision to not let his buddies “mount” the women.  That’s the word they chose to use.  Repeatedly.  Anyhow, she wins the argument - her husband sides with her because he says her fire is from his son (the stallion who will mount the world - which I guess in this context means the dude who will have sex with everyone, rape everyone) inside her.  Because women are merely vessels and her fire could only be from the thing she carries not from herself.  Because feminism hasn’t been invented yet.  So I guess we can look forward to seeing a bunch of people fighting!  So many armies now!  So many swords!  Boy, I can’t wait.

                <p>Ned is still in prison.  That’s your King’s Landing update.  Jon Snow gets presented a pretty new/old sword for killing the white walkers.  Seems he’s being made a Ranger.  I mean, there wasn’t a ceremony or anything, but that’s what I’m guessing.  Then Jon finds out about how his brother Rob is starting an army.  He obvs wants to go join, but the old librarian guy decides to monologue at him about . . .I dunno duty, honor, exposition.  I did catch that it turns out he the Mad King’s brother.  Which would make him related to Khaleesi somehow.  Uncle maybe?  Oh right so Rob and his army arrive at a bridge that’s owned by these people who’s ruler is Lemony Snicket. Joan Allen goes and makes a deal with him.  Basically they gotta take one of his sons as a squire, Arya has to marry one of his other sons (yeah right, like she’d ever let that happen), and Rob’s gotta marry one his daughters.  You know, not right now, but like one day.  So crossing the bridge - check.  Hope they don’t have too many more bridges because there’s only like two more children (if you count blonde kid from last time who is either the youngest Stark or Bran’s imaginary friend, time will tell) to marry off.  The Lannister/Viking/Pirate/Hill People army is gearing up.  Dwarf gets a new lady.  He acquires her by way of sending his knight/body guard to go pick him up one.  The three of them look like they’re having a sleepover, hanging out in the tent with all the pillows, playing some medieval version of Never Have I Ever.  We learn next to nothing about her.  But guess what?!  The Dwarf Man gets a monologue!  This one is about how he fell in love and got married to a girl he thought he helped rescue from rapists, but was really a prostitute that his brother set him up with.  Imagine his heartbreak.  You don’t have to imagine because he is still monologuing about it!  His dad (charming guy that he is) passes her to his guards and makes little Tyrian watch them gang rape her.  This show is aspirational.  I get it, y’all.  Don’t we all long to live in this fantasy world?  Uh huh, right.  OK so the battle we luckily miss because dwarf is knocked unconscious immediately and so we are spared.  #blessed.  You know what we were not spared?  The ongoing horrors of the Dothrakians.  Criss Angel seems to be dying from an infected wound and Khaleesi sanctions some witchcraft to be done which of course involves killing his horse.  So horse killing that we get to see.  Also Khaleesi seems to be almost giving birth and then we leave her.  Finally, back in King’s Landing we find that Arya is living on the street and that she’s about to witness her dad getting executed.  Ned has sworn up and down that he will not give a false confession of treason.  But when standing up in front of a crowd and both his daughters he decides to go ahead and be like I did it, guys.  I’m sorry.  I totally committed all the treason.  And then that dick Joffrey ordered him beheaded.  And then that’s what happens. Y’all, Ned died.  That’s what happened right?  My friend here doesn’t want to believe it.  But I’m going with the simplest explanation is the right one. So he’s dead OK?  We all gotta just accept it and move on.</p>
